                        One of my biggest hobbies happens to be motorcycles.<br>
                        I have been riding on 2 wheels since I was 3 years old.<br>
                        My first dirt bike was a pw50 and this happens to be close<br>
                        to my first memories. I am now 20 and have owned 8 different<br>
                        bikes since then. Working on them, riding, anything motorcycle<br>
                        I love.

                        Another passion I have is sports. I believe the picture I have<br>
                        chosen speaks for my love of sports as well. Pictured is NBA legend<br>
                        Kobe Bryant. I was fortunate enough to be able to see my idol play<br>
                        in his final season at the Indianapolis Pacers arena. Kobes love for<br>
                        the game hasd tought me many lessons that not only helped me in athletics,<br>
                        but in life as well. Kobe and sports helped me realize that every day is<br>
                        a chance to be better, a chance to seperate yourself from the competition.<br>
                        This attitude has helped me come a long way and is a big part of why I still<br>
                        hold sports so closely.

                    <p>
                        By the picture you can see I am kind of a shoe addict. These are a portion<br>
                        of my personal collection ranging from basketball to your everyday lifestyle<br>
                        shoes. My love for shoes began in fifth grade when my grandma let me NikeID<br>
                        my school shoes for that year. Back then NikeID was a lot better than it is<br> 
                        today. After that designing shoes became an obsession. I now have notebooks<br>
                        filled with designs of sneakers. Getting a new pair is like christmas for me.

                        Lastly some information about myself not hobby related. My Name is Alec Johns,<br>
                        I am a 20 year old part time student at Lmabda School. My code experience before<br>
                        Lambda was next to nothing. Prior to Lambda I went to college for Computer Drafting.<br> 
                        I was 3 classes from graduating when I relaized that it was not what I wanted to <br>
                        spend my life doing. After taking the next semester off, I discovered Lambda, and<br>
                        here I am today!
